# MobHunting
An Example Plugin that allows users to hunt mobs and place heads in the world via chat command.


The plugin makes Entities drop specified heads on death.
This can be configured to include new mobs, or function for custom mobs (If you can find a user-head for the mob)

Values for dropping is 0.0 (0% of the time) to 1.0 (100% of the time)
i.e 0.5 = 50% of the time, on that mob's death.
